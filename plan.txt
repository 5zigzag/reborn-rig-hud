TODO LIST:

add a visible timer for the mission rotation countdown

reset the view when missions rotate
   UFSDGameInstance::GetGlobalMissionSeed()
   UFSDGameInstance::UpdateGlobelMissionSeed()

show current beer, also with rotation timer

show length/complexity, or is this not necessary and will just add clutter?

set up true weighting/sorting for the "best missions"
   UMissionGenerationManager might be able to generate test missions
