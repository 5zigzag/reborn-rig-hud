MISSION HILITE FEATURE:

run once on rig load, with just a few seconds of wait for the fade in
read all UGeneratedMission from the game state
filter the list of missions by hilite criteria (just double XP or all yellows?)
--need to detect URewardMutator ?
show results in grouped lists
where possible, reuse the official icons, which should even play nice with other mods

example:
-double XP (icon)
--mission type (icon)
--UBiome (ftext)
--complexity, duration, secondary obj (icons)
--mission name (totally random, but fun to see)
--mutators and warnings (each mission might have multiple of each, though we will know one of them is double XP which can be omitted)


later: rerun this when missions rotate (for testing, try to run "regenerate missions" on a separate short timer)
   UFSDGameInstance::GetGlobalMissionSeed()
   UFSDGameInstance::UpdateGlobelMissionSeed()
later: also add a visible timer for the mission rotation countdown

hard: add highlights to the biomes and missions for the hilited criteria

later: instead of a simple grouping, find the "best top 3 missions" by some weighting
-near the top would be double XP, mineral mania, and double warnings
later: UMissionGenerationManager might be able to generate test missions consistently.


BEER FEATURE:
-show current beer at the top
-add a timer to show the beer rotation
-update the beer when it rotates
